# CS-7641 Randomized optimization

URL for code
https://github.com/mkmukund10/assignment2

All data is stored under data folder and plots under plot folder.

This project implements the following 3 different optimization problemusing RHC, SA, GA, and MIMIC and compare these optimization algortihm using NN.
- Flip Flop
- Continuous Peak
- N-Queens


## Getting Started

### Installing dependencies and running experiments
The implementation is done through jupyter notebook

Install anaconda for running the notebooks
Install mlrose-hiive- pip install mlrose-hiive

```

You can also individually run the experiments by launching the notebooks using jupyter notebook console

```
For example-

Part 1 - Flip_Flop.ipynb
Part 2 - ANN.ipynb

```
